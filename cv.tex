\section{Research Activities}

\paragraph{Master thesis research project}

During my master's degree program I started working on a project with the goal of finding genes whose \textit{cis-}regulated expression is associated to a complex disease. This approach, commonly known as a transcriptome-wide association study, exploits a chain of associations: first from genetic variants to gene expression, and then from expression to disease. I wrote code to perform the prediction of gene expression from the DNA sequence, and then to associate the predicted expression to the disease status. The novelty of our approach is that the prediction is based on the affinities of transcription factors for the DNA sequence, rather than on the raw genotypes. The project also involved the reconstruction and analysis of a regulatory network. I implemented an R package (\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fplyr/index.html}{fplyr}) to help me performing these analyses.

\paragraph{Previous activities} When I joined Prof. Provero's lab for my bachelor's thesis, I contributed to the existing research projects of the group, focused on the characterisation of SNP-disease association through the effect of the SNP on the affinity of the DNA sequence for transcription factors; I performed some basic computational analyses.

\paragraph{Side projects} I developed an environment to automatically organise the data we download at our lab into appropriate folders, and to manage our research projects, enforcing good practices of workflow development, in a multi-user setting (\href{https://github.com/fmarotta/bioinfoconda}{https://github.com/fmarotta/bioinfoconda}).
