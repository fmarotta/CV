abstract = {In the last decades, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered tens of thousands of associations between common genetic variants and complex diseases. However, these statistical associations can rarely be interpreted functionally and mechanistically. As the majority of the disease-associated variants are located far from coding sequences, even the relevant gene is often unclear. A way to gain insight into the relevant mechanisms is to study the genetic determinants of intermediate molecular phenotypes, such as gene expression and transcript structure. We propose a computational strategy to discover genetic variants affecting the relative expression of alternative 3' untranslated region (UTR) isoforms, generated through alternative polyadenylation, a widespread post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism known to have relevant functional consequences. When applied to a large dataset in which whole genome and RNA sequencing data are available for 373 European individuals, 2,530 genes with alternative polyadenylation quantitative trait loci (apaQTL) were identified. We analyze and discuss possible mechanisms of action of these variants, and we show that they are significantly enriched in GWAS hits, in particular those concerning immune-related and neurological disorders. Our results point to an important role for genetically determined alternative polyadenylation in affecting predisposition to complex diseases, and suggest new ways to extract functional information from GWAS data.},

abstract = {The study of genetic variation has been revolutionized by the ad-vent of high-throughput technologies able to determine the complete genomic sequence of thousands of individuals. Understanding the functional relevance of variants is however still a difficult tasks, es-pecially when focusing on non-coding variants. Most of the variants associated to disease by Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are indeed non-coding, and presumably exert their effects by altering gene regulation. Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) stud-ies represent an important step in understanding the functional rel-evance of regulatory variants. We propose a new strategy to detect and characterize eQTLs, based on the effect of variants on the Total Binding Affinity (TBA) profiles of regulatory regions. Using a large scale dataset of coupled genome and expression data we show that TBA-based inference allows the identification of eQTLs not revealed by traditional methods and helps in their interpretation in terms of altered transcription factor binding.},

abstract = {We present fplyr, a new package for the R language to deal with big files. It allows users to easily implement the split-apply-combine strategy for files that are too big to fit into the available memory, without relying on data bases nor introducing non-native R classes. A custom function can be applied independently to each group of observations, and the results may be either returned or directly printed to one or more output files.},
